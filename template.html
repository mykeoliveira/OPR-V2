                                <p align="justify">The Open Programming Resource (OPR) is an Open Educational Resource (OER) adapted for introductory programming concepts. Open Educational Resources are teaching and learning materials that are available for the public to be accessed, used and adapted with no restrictions (UNESCO, 2002).</p>
                                <p align="justify">To promote an environment that addresses student characteristics, the OPR identifies the authors cognitive styles and expertise levels. The students' cognitive styles represent how the student prefers to receive some type of information (e.g., some students prefer videos, others prefer to read texts, among others). The expertise levels, on the other hand, illustrate how much of the preliminary knowledge the student has when using the educational resource. The expertise levels are divided among basic, medium and advanced.   </p>
                                <p align="justify">To access the resource, the user needs to sign up and log in. Then, two questionnaires will be applied, one to identify the cognitive style and the other to identify the level of expertise. With this, the OPR will create a profile consisting of the student's cognitive style and level of expertise. This profile will determine the types of materials that will be recommended to the student considering their level of expertise.</p>
